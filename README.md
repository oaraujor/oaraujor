## About Me

Hi, I'm Octavio a computer science and pure mathematics student with a curious mind, a whiteboard always within reach, and an unshakable belief that Linux is the better choice for development (because it is).

I started coding in high school with Visual Basic and C++, which thankfully evolved into C and Python.
These days, I focus on building small-but-ambitious projects that mix logic, structure, and a little aesthetic chaos (looking at you, fractals).

## What I’m Working On

- **Interactive Fractal Tree Visualizer**: An artistic and recursive dive into fractals, still in development.
- **Cube World Simulation**: A reimagining of Radica’s Cube World, built to run as a desktop companion.
- **Hospital Management System**: One of my school projects; serious in scope, humble in design.

I'm just getting started on GitHub, a lot of my work is local, personal, or academic. But I plan to change that.

## Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** C/C++, Python
- **Languages I'd like to learn:** Rust
- **Operating System:** Linux (Gentoo preferred)  
- **Tools:** Bash, GitHub  
- **Learning Goals:** Containers, system-level programming, simulations and system administration.

## Education & Certification

- **Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science** - In progress  
- **Red Hat System Administration I (RH124 - RHA 9.3)** – Completed  
- **Current Goal:** Land an internship to apply my knowledge in real-world projects and keep learning beyond textbooks.

## How I Work

I approach programming like a math problem: analyze it, map it on a whiteboard, sketch some wild ideas, and then bring order to the chaos.
If things get too tangled, I don’t mind burning it all down and starting fresh...creatively, of course.

Philosophy:  
> *“Keep it simple, but not underwhelming. If it breaks, rebuild smarter.”*

## Interests

- **Pure Mathematics**: Logic, abstraction, and the occasional brain ache.  
- **Simulations**: I enjoy building small, contained worlds (especially if they bounce).  
- **Operating Systems**: Linux has my full attention.

## The Road Ahead

Right now, I’m looking for internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of systems, development workflows, and software design. Until then, you’ll find me coding, studying, or rethinking the structure of yet another array.

*This README will evolve, just like my codebase — and hopefully with fewer bugs.*
