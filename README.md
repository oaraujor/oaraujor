## About Me

I am a bachelor’s student in Computer Science at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL), with a strong interest in system-level programming, simulations, and pure mathematics.
I have experience programming in C/C++ and Python, and I work primarily in Linux environments using tools such as Bash and Git.

I began programming in high school with basic level C++ and Visual Basic, and later developed a deeper interest in systems and software design through university coursework and personal projects.

## Interests

I am particularly interested in system-level topics within computer science, including operating systems, cybersecurity, embedded systems, and low-level programming.
I aim to deepen my understanding of compilers, kernel development, and containerization technologies.

In mathematics, my focus is on discrete structures and algebraic systems, with an emphasis on graph theory, ring theory, and modules.

I am also interested in academic research and plan to explore research literature related to systems, security, and theoretical computer science.

## Approach to Problem Solving

I use a structured approach to debugging and development, beginning with analysis and visualization on a whiteboard.
I prioritize simplicity and maintainability in code, and I’m not hesitant to refactor or rebuild when necessary to improve clarity or correctness.
